<h1>Recipe whitelist</h1>

<p>If the eatery's menu is known ahead of time, we can create a "whitelist" of allowed foods â€” other foods won't be recognized, and we won't offer recipes for them.</p>

<form method='POST'>
  <p>Enter foods (not recipes), separated by blank lines:</p>
  <p>(leave this box empty to allow any food)</p>
  <textarea class='large' name='foods'>{{ foods }}</textarea>
  <p><input type='submit'/></p>
</form>
